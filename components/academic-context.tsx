        Asian American Studies Context

          The history of San Jose's five Chinatowns represents a critical case
          study in Asian American studies, illustrating patterns of immigration,
          community formation, discrimination, and resilience that characterized
          the Chinese American experience in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

          These communities emerged during a period of intense anti-Chinese
          sentiment in California, exemplified by the Chinese Exclusion Act of
          1882—the first U.S. law to specifically prevent immigration based on
          ethnicity. The systematic destruction of San Jose's Chinatowns through
          arson and other means reflects the institutional racism faced by
          Chinese immigrants.
